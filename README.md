# Async Search

Async Search is a piece of code that can be used to create async search component for any project. It is built on the top of react-select package async search component.

I just wrote some code on the top of it and made it reusable component with some specfications

## Installation

Clone the repo and use this component or can modify it as per use


## Usage

I have written comments for better understanding of usage of this component. 

Just pass settings in props as you need 

* you can pass api endpoint from which search action will happen
* request response structure can be managed
* default value, placeholder, css class are also some props 

but as I said you can modify as per your convenience
